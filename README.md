# Tonny Mwangi - FEB 2025 PLP HACKATHON

Welcome to my personal portfolio website! This project showcases my skills, experience, and projects as a software developer and entrepreneur. It is designed to provide an engaging and professional online presence.
I built it for FEB 2025 Cohort Hackathon, PLP Africa. The design language of the website is a minimalist white theme with many white spaces to improve readability and bring out a professional yet premium touch to a modern Software Developer portfolio website. Simplicity here is key.
